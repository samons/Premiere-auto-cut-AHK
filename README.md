#Most important thing (and issue with this script but I'm too lazy to fix it), is that you need to change the variable numberofclips at the start of the file otherwise the script will crash or otherwise behave unexpectedly  
also you need to select all video and audio tracks or the unselected ones will be deleted  
You can exit the script at any time by pressing escape (ESC)
